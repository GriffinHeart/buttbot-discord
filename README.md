ButtBot Discord (A Discord ButtBot)
==========================
ButtBot Discord is a homage to my favorite IRC bot in existence, the buttbot. It serves one simple purpose, comedy.

ButtBot Discord currently pales in comparison to the original buttbots beautiful and intelligent architecture but still tends to create the same amount of laughs.

Finally updated this to work again on the latest API.
